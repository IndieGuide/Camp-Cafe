Thanks for purchasing 2D Mesh with Waves.



Visit scene called Demo or Demo 2 and hit play. Now you see 4 waves.

For using asset in your project do the following:
1) Drag one of the prefabs in your scene.
2) Adjust the script properties to your liking. (If you don't want random effect, set amplitudeEffectRange, periodEffectRange, amplitudeEffectSpeed and periodEffectSpeed to zero)
3) Assign a material to Mesh Renderer.												 

If you want to add a collider to the wave do the following:							 
1) Add a WaveCollider.cs to the wave gameobject.									 
Note: Recreating a collider each frame is causing high cpu usage. Try to lower the pointConcetration for better performance.

What's new in version two?
-Circular Waves
-Random effect based on perlin noise
-Mixing multiple waves into one (If you don't want to mix waves, set waves to one)
